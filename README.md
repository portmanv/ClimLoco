# Installation 
The needed packages may have conflictual versions. We recommand the use of a virtual environment where the packages versions are fixed. We proposes this procedure:
- Install anaconda https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
- Open Anaconda Navigator
- Go to the tab "Environments". Create a new environment named for example toolbox. In this step I have chosen python version 3.9.19.
- Go to the tab "Home". Make sure you use the new environment created, "toolbox", indicated on the top. Click on "Install" on Jupyter Notebook.
- Click on "Launch" on Jupyter Notebook. A tab should open on your browser. Open the "ClimLoco" file, go to /notebook
- Open and run "install_packages.ipynb" to install automatically all needed packages.
