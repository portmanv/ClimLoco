# ClimLoco1.0
This repository is attached to the article titled "ClimLoco1.0: CLimate variable confidence Interval of Multivariate Linear Observational COnstraint".

The use of ClimLoco1.0 is illustrated in a simple example, user-friendly, in the form of a python notebook. You can either watch it through the following link, or download the git repository to being able to run it on your own device and modify it (see the next section "installation").

The repository "notebooks" also contains:
- the notebook "figures_synthetic_data.ipynb", producing the main figures of the article from synthetic data,
- the notebook "case_study.ipynb", producing the figures and sensitivity tests from a real case study, of the corresponding appendix in the article.

# Installation
The required packages may have conflicting versions. We recommend using a virtual environment where the package versions are fixed. We propose the following procedure:
Install Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/.
Open Anaconda Navigator.
- Go to the 'Environments' tab. Create a new environment named 'toolbox', for example. In this step, choose Python version 3.9.19.
- Go to the "Home" tab. Make sure you are using the new "toolbox" environment, indicated at the top. Click on 'Install' on Jupyter Notebook.
Click on 'Launch' on Jupyter Notebook. A new tab should open in your browser. Open the 'ClimLoco' file and go to /notebook.
Open and run 'install_packages.ipynb' to automatically install all the necessary packages.
